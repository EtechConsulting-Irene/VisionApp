Working with visual studio code is easier
ls -i   --> to display the inode number of a directory content 
- cp -r d1/*  --> technique to copy the entire directory content at once
- cp -r d1/*.var --> to copy everything with the '.var' extension (files only Because directories do NOT have extensions)
